TERRAFORM TASK 3 â€“ Multi-Environment Infrastructure Setup

In this task, we are using Terraform to create and manage infrastructure across different environments: development (dev), testing (test), and production (prod). The project is organized in a modular way, which means different parts of the infrastructure (like EC2, VPC, Subnets, etc.) are separated into reusable components called modules. This approach makes the code more organized, easier to manage, and scalable when more resources or environments are added later.
